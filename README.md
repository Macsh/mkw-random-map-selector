# 🏁 Mario Kart World Random Map Selector

A Progressive Web App (PWA) that randomly selects Mario Kart World circuits for multiplayer racing sessions. Perfect for tournament organization and competitive play!

## 🎯 About This Project

This project was created as an experiment in **"vibe coding"** - a development approach focused on intuitive, creative coding without strict planning. The entire application was built collaboratively with **Claude Sonnet 3.5**, exploring how AI-assisted development can create fully functional, production-ready applications through natural conversation and iterative improvements.

**Everything in this project was generated by Claude Sonnet 3.5** - from the initial React components and CSS styling to the PWA configuration, asset optimization, and even this README documentation. The development process involved no traditional coding on the human side, only conversational direction and feedback.

The goal was to see how far we could push the boundaries of conversational programming, building a complete PWA from concept to deployment using modern web technologies and best practices, entirely through AI assistance.

## ✨ Features

- **Random Circuit Selection**: Choose from all 30 Mario Kart World tracks
- **Flexible Session Lengths**: 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 16, or 32 races
- **Player Management**: Track up to 4 players with tournament standings
- **Smart Duplicate Prevention**: For 32-race sessions, prevents duplicates in the last 8 races
- **Bilingual Support**: Toggle between English and French with flag buttons (🇺🇸/🇫🇷)
- **Responsive Design**: 
  - Desktop: Full world map with highlighted circuits
  - Mobile: Zoomed circuit view + mini-map with location pin
- **Offline Support**: Works without internet connection (PWA)
- **Tournament Tracking**: Points system with final standings and race history

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd mkw-random-map-selector
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## 🛠️ Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint for code quality checks

## 📱 PWA Features

This app is installable as a Progressive Web App:
- Works offline once installed
- Can be added to your home screen on mobile devices
- Background updates for new features

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Choose Language**: Toggle between English 🇺🇸 and French 🇫🇷 using the flag buttons
2. **Select Race Count**: Choose how many races you want (3-32)
3. **Add Players** (Optional): Enter player names for tournament tracking
4. **Start Session**: Begin your random circuit selection
5. **Race Progress**: View each selected circuit on the world map
6. **Enter Results**: Record player positions after each race (if players added)
7. **View Results**: See final standings and complete race history

## 🗺️ Map Integration

The app includes placeholders for Mario Kart World map coordinates. To add the actual world map:

1. Add your world map image to `public/` directory
2. Update circuit coordinates in `src/data/circuits.js`
3. Modify the WorldMap component to use the actual image

## 🏆 Tournament System

Points are awarded based on finishing position:
- 1st place: 15 points
- 2nd place: 12 points  
- 3rd place: 10 points
- 4th place: 8 points
- And so on...

## 🔧 Technical Stack

- **React 18** - UI framework
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **Vanilla CSS** - Styling with CSS Grid/Flexbox
- **Vite PWA Plugin** - Progressive Web App functionality
- **Workbox** - Service worker and caching

## 🎯 Development Approach

This project demonstrates **"vibe coding"** - an experimental development methodology that emphasizes:
- **Conversational Programming**: Building software through natural language interaction
- **Iterative Refinement**: Continuous improvement based on real-time feedback
- **AI-Human Collaboration**: Leveraging Claude Sonnet 3.5 for full-stack development
- **Intuitive Design**: Following user experience instincts rather than rigid specifications

The result is a fully functional PWA built entirely through AI-assisted development, showcasing the potential of modern AI tools in creating production-ready applications.

## 🎯 Roadmap

- [x] ~~Add actual Mario Kart World map integration~~
- [x] ~~Implement player position input modal~~
- [x] ~~Add sound effects and animations~~
